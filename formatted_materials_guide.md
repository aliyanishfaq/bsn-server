# 1. All Materials
- **Column Grid Layouts**: Aim for regular column grid layouts and typical bays.
- **Gravity Components**: Stack vertically aligned gravity components to avoid column transfer beams/girders when possible.

# 2. Steel
- **Span-to-Depth Ratios**: Target span-to-depth ratios of 18-20 for typical steel beams.
- **Component Length**: Aim for beam, girder, truss, and column lengths under 45 feet in total or spliced segments. Longer lengths present shipping issues and may increase transportation costs to the build site.

# 3. Concrete
- **Column and Wall Placement**: Place columns and walls away from slab edges if possible; a modest 6-8 ft cantilever improves interior bay performance for deflection and strength.
- **Avoid Corner Columns**: Avoid placing columns at slab corners to prevent punching shear.
- **Span-to-Depth Ratios**: Target slab or beam span-to-depth ratios of 24-36, considering factors like post-tensioning, pan joists, or hollow core panels.
- **Wall Shear Stress**: Total concrete wall area in plan (length x thickness) for planar walls in one orthogonal direction should ensure wall shear stress remains below 4√(f’c). This check requires determining the building’s base shear and loading for each floor.

# 4. Wood
- **Span-to-Depth Ratios**: Aim for span-to-depth ratios of 15 for typical wood joists and beams.
- **Diaphragm Sensitivity**: Diaphragms in wood-framed designs are sensitive to lateral element layouts:
   - Limit diaphragm spans between lateral-supporting elements to 40 ft.
   - Maintain aspect ratios (span-to-depth) of no more than 4:1 between supports.
   - Cantilevered diaphragm portions should not exceed 25 ft or ⅔ of the length of their backspan.
